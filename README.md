=========

[ALNJ](https://alnj.fr/) is a parents organization in charge of extra-curricular activities and school fairs.
This project sets up a tool that will help the parents in charge of the organization of the annual school fair : it splits
automatically volunteers-parents on the differents stalls they have to animate.
 
## Technologies used :

* Symfony 4.1
* PHP 7.1 
* SonataAdminBundle 3.3 : this bundle is a bit oversized for this kind of project. I chose it to practise it with its basic features and understand how it works.

## Installation :
WIP
